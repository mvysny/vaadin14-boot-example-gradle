# Vaadin 14 npm+webpack running in Embedded Jetty using Gradle

A demo project showing the possibility of running a Vaadin 14 app from an
embedded Jetty, as a simple `main()` method. Written in Java. Uses [Vaadin Boot](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-boot).

Both the development and production modes are supported. Also, the project
demoes packaging itself into a zip file containing
a list of jars and a runner script. See "Packaging for production" below
for more details.

The [Vaadin 14 Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/vaadin/vaadin-gradle-plugin)
is used to package all JavaScript dependencies via npm+webpack. See the Plugin
home page for more details.
